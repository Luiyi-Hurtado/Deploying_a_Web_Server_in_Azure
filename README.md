# Azure Infrastructure Operations Project: Deploying a scalable IaaS web server in Azure

## Introduction

For this project, you will write a Packer template and a Terraform template to deploy a customizable, scalable web server in Azure.

### Getting Started

1. Clone this repositorys

2. Create your infrastructure as code

3. Update this README to reflect how someone would use your code.

### Dependencies

1. Create an [Azure Account](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Install the [Azure command line interface](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)
3. Install [Packer](https://www.packer.io/downloads)
4. Install [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)

## Instructions

### 1. Login to Azure

* Open your terminal and run the following command to log in to Azure:

    ```bash
    az login
    ```

* Follow the prompts to complete the login process.

### 2. Create an Azure Policy Definition

* Create an Azure Policy Definition using the following command. Replace ```<policy name>``` with your desired policy name and ```<filename>``` with the path to your policy definition rules file:

    ```bash
    az policy definition create --name <policy name> --rulesÂ <filename>
    ```

### 3. Build an Image with Packer

* Build a custom image using Packer by running the following command. Replace ```<filename>``` with the path to your Packer configuration file:

     ```bash
     packer build <filename>
     ```

### 4. Initialize Resources

If you need to remove the resources created by Terraform, use the following command. Replace ```<filename>``` with the path to your execution plan file:

* Navigate to your Terraform configuration directory in the terminal.
* Run the following command to initialize Terraform:

     ```sh
     terraform init
     ```

### 5. Changing Variables in vars.tf

#### 1. Locate the vars.tf File

* Navigate to the directory where your Terraform configuration is located.
* Inside this directory, you'll find a file named ``vars.tf``. This is where you can define and modify input variables.

#### 2. Edit the Variable Values

* Open the ``var.tf`` file using a text editor of your choice (e.g., ``VSCode``, ``Notepad``, ``Vim``).
* In this file, you'll find variable definitions using the variable block. Locate the variable(s) you want to change.

#### 3. Modify Variable Values

* Within the ``variable`` block, you'll see the name, type, and default value of the variable.
* To change a variable's value, update the ``default`` attribute with your desired value.
* Save the changes after editing the variable(s).

### 6. Generate Terraform Execution Plan

* Create a Terraform execution plan by running the following command. Replace ```<filename>``` with the desired output file name for the execution plan:

     ```sh
     terraform plan -out <filename>
     ```

### 7. Apply Terraform Configuration

* Apply the Terraform configuration to create the resources in your Azure environment. Use the execution plan file generated in the previous step. Replace ```<filename>``` with the path to your execution plan file:

     ```sh
     terraform apply <filename>
     ```

### 8. View Terraform State

* To view the current state of your resources managed by Terraform, run the following command:

    ```sh
    terraform show
    ```

### 9. Destroy Resources

* If you need to remove the resources created by Terraform, use the following command. Replace ```<filename>``` with the path to your execution plan file:

     ```sh
     terraform destroy <filename>
     ```

## Output

### 1. Create an Azure Policy

```sh
~/Deploying_a_Web_Server_in_Azure$ az policy definition create --name taggin-policy --rules policy.json
Mode     Name           PolicyType
-------  -------------  ------------
Indexed  taggin-policy  Custom
```

### 2. Build an Image with Packer

```sh
:~/Deploying_a_Web_Server_in_Azure$ packer build server.json
azure-arm: output will be in this color.

==> azure-arm: Running builder ...
    azure-arm: Creating Azure Resource Manager (ARM) client ...
==> azure-arm: Getting source image id for the deployment ...
==> azure-arm:  -> SourceImageName: '/subscriptions/{user `subscrition_id`}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/locations/East US/publishers/Canonical/ArtifactTypes/vmimage/offers/UbuntuServer/skus/18.04-LTS/versions/latest'

==> azure-arm:  -> DeploymentName    : 'pkrdpf45edmeyio'
[...]
==> Wait completed after 2 minutes 58 seconds

==> Some builds didn't complete successfully and had errors:
--> azure-arm: Script exited with non-zero exit status: 1. Allowed exit codes are: [0]

==> Builds finished but no artifacts were created.
```

### 3. Terraform Plan

```sh
~/Deploying_a_Web_Server_in_Azure$ terraform plan -out solution.plan

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create
  Terraform will perform the following actions:
